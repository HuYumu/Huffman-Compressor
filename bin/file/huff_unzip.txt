Governments run on taxes, which is one of the major means of capital generation for a country. Income tax helps fund public services, provide goods for citizens, and pay for government obligations. While the amount varies from country to country, most nations' personal income taxes have a progressive tax structure. This means the tax rate paid by individuals increases as they earn higher wages.

Furthermore, there are two types of income tax: personal income tax and corporate income tax. Personal income tax applies to an individual's salary, wage, and other types of income. Corporate tax applies to corporations, businesses, partnerships, and the self-employed.
